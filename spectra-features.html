    What do these features mean if you are an admin? This means that Spectra, a <em><span class="highlight">completely free</span></em> bot, provides you with features that most bots require you to pay for.
        </p>
        <p>
    If you are <em><span class="highlight">paranoid</span></em> about losing an entire server, you can enable these features and even if the system does not detect these, you can recover your server's channels and roles using a simple /backup command (Server Backup is still under development, but it will be released to the public as soon as it is completely ready without any bugs!)
        </p>
        <p>
              <strong>Spam detection: </strong> Detects if a user is spamming in a channel. If a user sends 5 messages in a time window of 10 seconds, the bot will detect the user as a spammer and warn them. </p><p>
              <strong>Anti-Swearing System: </strong> If you do not want any bad words in your server's messages, you can enable this feature. Now, every user's messages will be checked for a bad word (NOTE: no message is stored by Spectra, the message is processed by lines of code from a list of bad words and immediately discards the messages.) and IF the user HAS sent a bad word, their message would be instantly deleted and the user will be warned in the DM once again. </p><p>
              <strong>Anti-Raid System: </strong> This feature is a very good feature to have in a server. If a user or multiple users are spamming messages (20 messages in 5 seconds) in a channel, the bot will automatically lock every channel in the server and everyone with the <code>Ban members</code> will be DMed by the bot for immediate action. </p> <p>
    <strong>Automatic Server Creator: </strong> If you plan on starting a new server, but are too lazy to create multiple channels and do not like Discord's pre-generated server templates, you can instead use Spectra's server templates (which can first be viewed using <code>/servertemplate</code>) and create a server using the <code>/servercreate</code> command. You also get the option to automatically add emojis in front of channel names!
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Levelling System: </strong> If you want to make your server more engaging and have a fun and interactive server, you can enable this feature and have a fun and engaging server!
      </p>
