    What do these features mean if you are an admin? This means that Spectra, a <em><span class="highlight">completely free</span></em> bot, provides you with features that most bots require you to pay for.
        </p>
        <p>
    If you are <em><span class="highlight">paranoid</span></em> about losing an entire server, you can enable these features and even if the system does not detect these, you can recover your server's channels and roles using a simple /backup command (Server Backup is still under development, but it will be released to the public as soon as it is completely ready without any bugs!)
        </p>
        <p>
              <strong>Spam detection: </strong> Automatically monitors and mitigates spam messages to maintain a clean and orderly chat environment, improving server usability.</p><p>
              <strong>Anti-Swearing System: </strong> If you do not want any bad words in your server's messages, you can enable this feature. Now, every user's messages will be checked for a bad word (NOTE: no message is stored by Spectra, the message is processed by lines of code from a list of bad words and immediately discards the messages.) and IF the user HAS sent a bad word, their message would be instantly deleted and the user will be warned in the DM once again. </p><p>
              <strong>Anti-Raid System: </strong> This feature is a very good feature to have in a server. If a user or multiple users are spamming messages (20 messages in 5 seconds) in a channel, the bot will automatically lock every channel in the server and everyone with the <code>Ban members</code> will be DMed by the bot for immediate action. </p> <p>
    <strong>Automatic Server Creator: </strong> Simplifies server setup by automating the creation of channels, with the option to have emojis against the channel names, saving time for administrators for other important things like roles.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Levelling System: </strong> Rewards user activity with XP and levels, encouraging participation and creating friendly competition through customizable progression systems.
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Server Backup: </strong> Provides an option to save and restore server configurations, roles, and other settings, ensuring quick recovery in case of accidental changes or data loss.
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Ticketing: </strong> Allows users to create private "tickets" for support or inquiries. Useful for handling issues like moderation appeals, or support efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Invite Tracker: </strong> Tracks how many users someone has invited to the server. Great for running invite-based giveaways, recognizing active members, or monitoring recruitment efforts.
