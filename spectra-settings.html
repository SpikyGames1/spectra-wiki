        <h2>Spam Detection</h2>
        <hr size=2 color="white">
        <p>
The spam detection system is designed to maintain server harmony by identifying and mitigating excessive message activity. It continuously monitors user behavior, specifically checking for repeated or rapid message sending that could disrupt conversations. When a user is flagged for spamming, the system issues a warning, giving them an opportunity to correct their behavior. This system ensures that the server remains a friendly and organized environment, free from disruptions caused by excessive or irrelevant messages.  
</p>
<p>
<hr size=2 color="white">
<h2>Raid Detection</h2>
<hr size=2 color="white">
</p>
<p>
  Raid detection is a crucial feature to protect servers from large-scale disruptions. A raid typically involves a coordinated attack where multiple users, often bots, flood a server with spam messages to render it unusable. The system proactively scans for abnormal message activity across multiple channels. Upon detection, it triggers an automated lockdown, temporarily restricting all chats to prevent further damage. People with the <code>Ban Members</code> are notified immediately, allowing them to review and address the situation.
</p>
<p>
<hr size=2 color="white">
<h2>Leveling system</h2>
<hr size=2 color="white">
</p>
<p>
  The leveling system adds an engaging gamification aspect to server interaction, rewarding users for active participation. Members earn 1 XP point for every 2 letters typed, encouraging meaningful conversations rather than short or spammy replies. As users accumulate XP, they progress through levels, with each subsequent level requiring more XP to achieve (The way to calculate the required amount of XP to level up is: <code>100 × (current level + 1) </code>). Upon leveling up, a celebratory message is sent, highlighting their achievement and encouraging continued activity. The system also includes a leaderboard showcasing top-ranked users, fostering friendly competition.  
</p>
<p>
<hr size=2 color="white">
<h2>Anti-Swearing</h2>
<hr size=2 color="white">
</p>
<p>
The Anti-Swearing setting provides robust moderation capabilities by filtering inappropriate language in real-time. This setting ensures a safe and respectful environment for members, particularly in family-friendly or professional servers. When a bad word is detected, the bot automatically deletes the messages and warns the user. Anti-Swearing also includes advanced detection, reducing false positives while still being thorough. This feature helps maintain a positive atmosphere, discourages toxic behavior, and ensures the server remains welcoming for all users.

<h2>Invite Tracker</h2>
<hr size=2 color="white">
</p>
<p>
The Invite Tracker setting helps servers monitor user invitations, tracking who invited whom and how often. This feature is useful for rewarding active users, analyzing growth trends, or identifying suspicious activity like fake invites. Server admins can view detailed logs of invites and set up leaderboards to celebrate top contributors, fostering a sense of competition and community spirit. The Invite Tracker also integrates seamlessly with Spectra’s leveling and achievements systems, adding extra layers of engagement. Its customization options allow admins to tweak tracking methods or disable the feature if unnecessary, making it versatile and adaptable to all types of servers.

<h2>Ticketing</h2>
<hr size=2 color="white">
</p>
<p>
The Ticketing setting introduces a highly customizable support ticketing system to Spectra. It allows members to create tickets for various concerns, such as support requests, complaints, or suggestions, which are directed to designated staff channels. Tickets are easy to manage, creating a streamlined communication between members and moderators. With this system, servers can enhance their support process, ensuring queries are addressed efficiently while keeping conversations private and organized. It’s ideal for gaming communities, support forums, or customer-facing Discord servers.

<h2>Server Backup</h2>
<hr size=2 color="white">
</p>
<p>
The Server Backup setting in Spectra allows server owners to save and restore server configurations with ease. This includes roles, permissions, channel setups, and more. In the event of accidental changes, malicious activity, or server disruption, backups provide peace of mind by enabling swift recovery to a previously saved state. Server owners can also schedule automatic backups for consistent security or manually create them before major changes. The setting is especially valuable for large communities with complex setups, ensuring their structure remains intact. This feature helps maintain a seamless experience for members, regardless of unexpected events or errors.
